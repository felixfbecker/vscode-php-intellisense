THERE IS A 99% CHANCE YOU ARE FILING THIS ISSUE IN THE WRONG REPOSITORY.

This is just the repository for the thin VS Code extension.

If this issue is *not* directly related to the *integration* into VS Code,
but a bug, feature request, performance issue, crash, etc. it needs to be filed
in the repository of the *language server*:

https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server

Most likely there is already an open issue, please search for one first.

Thank you.
